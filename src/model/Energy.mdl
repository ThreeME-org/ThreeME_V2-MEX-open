# equation 9.10:Energy consumption of all households per source
   EN_HH[ce] = sum(EN_HH[ce, h] on h)

# equation 9.11: Energy consumption all households
   EN_HH = sum(EN_HH[ce] on ce)

# equation 9.12: Energy consumption from biomass for households
   EN_HH_BIOM = sum(EN_HH_BIOM[h] on h)

# equation 9.13: Energy consumption from housholds and sector by source
   EN_HH_SEC[ce] = EN_HH[ce] + EN_SOU[ce] 

# equation 9.14: Energy consumption from biomass
  EN_BIOM = EN_SEC_BIOM + EN_HH_BIOM
